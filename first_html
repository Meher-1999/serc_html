      HTML was first developed in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, and is short for
      Hypertext Markup Language. HTML produces electronic documents (called
      pages) that exist on the World Wide Web. Each page has a series of links
      to other pages, called hyperlinks. Each Web page you see on the Internet
      is written using one or another version of HTML code.

      HTML code ensures that your Internet browser formats text and images
      properly. A browser would not be able to display text as elements without
      HTML, or load images or other elements. HTML also offers a simple page
      layout to add Cascading Style Sheets to alter their appearance. One could
      think of HTML as a web page 's bones (structure), and of CSS as its skin
      (appearance).
